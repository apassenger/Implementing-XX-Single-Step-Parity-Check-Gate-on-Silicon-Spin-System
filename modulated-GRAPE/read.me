In this folder, we gave an example for using modulated control hamiltonian in GRAPE algorithm.
With this version of the code, instead of using two controls, we choose the direction in which we want to modulate the control Hamiltonian 
with a proper radial frequency. This frequency can be defined as the energy differences between the eigenstates of the system if we are driving in 
resonance. After specifying the frequency that we want to drive the system, we modulate the control Hamiltonian with a cosine (or sine) function 
for each time slot and run the algorithm for these control Hamiltonians. 
Here, the number of control Hamiltonians is equal to the number of time slots
